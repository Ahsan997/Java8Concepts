# Functional Interfaces:
It's important to note that a functional interface can still have default methods and static methods, but it must have only one abstract method to be considered a functional interface. If you add more than one abstract method to a functional interface, the Java compiler will raise an error, and it won't be a valid functional interface anymore.

In Java, you can explicitly define a functional interface using the @FunctionalInterface annotation. This annotation helps ensure that the interface indeed has only one abstract method. While it's not strictly required to use the annotation, it's considered good practice to do so, as it makes the intent clearer to other developers.

In Java, a functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. This single abstract method is also known as the functional interface's "functional method" or "functional signature." Java 8 introduced functional interfaces to support lambda expressions and functional programming constructs.
